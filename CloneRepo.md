# Setting up this repository in your local machine
## Clonig a Repository

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
Steps to follow are:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Above the list of files, click  Code.

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY 
```
7.Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
